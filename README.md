Virtual Pet Project
Basic virtual dog program that allows user to input name and breed.  The user then gets a display showing the dog's stats like "hunger", "thirst", and "boredom" levels.
The user can then enter a number to change the dog's stats.  The user always has the option to exit the program as well.
