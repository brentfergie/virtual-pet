Virtual Pet Project
Basic virtual dog program that allows user to input name and breed.  The user then gets a display showing the dog's stats like "hunger", "thirst", and "boredom" levels.
The user can then enter a number to change the dog's stats.  Decreasing some may increase others.  The dog will go to the bathroom on it's own and this will change the hunger level accordingly.  The user always has the option to exit the program as well.
